        <h3>Question</h3>
        <p>Our experiment aims to answer what type of shampoo is the most effective for our hair. </p>
        <p>What is the most efficient type of shampoo: natural, partly natural, or artificial?</p>
        <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
        <p>My teammate Yashi and I predicted that the partly natural shampoo will perform most efficiently. 
        <p>This is because partly natural shampoo has the benefit of both natural and aritifical substances.</p>  
        <h3>Observation</h3>
        <p>We observed 4 different experiments for each of our shampoos to test their efficiency.</p>
        <p>Coconut Shampoo (natural): succeeded 1/4 tests, the pH test</p>
        <p>Castile Soap Shampoo (partly-natural): performed average, failed only the pH test</p>
        <p>Store-Bought Soap Shampoo (artificial): succeeded 3/4 test, failed only the pH test</p>
        <h3>Experiment</h3>
        <p>#1. Prepare 5g of wool pieces to simulate it as hair</p>
        <p>#2. Create a sebum to simulate it as dirt</p>
        <p>#3. Prepare 3 kinds of shampoos: Coconut, Castile, and Artificial</p>
        <p>#4. Using a blank ink, test the cleaning power of each shampoos</p>
        <p>#5. Test the pH of each shampoos to know the compatibility with our skin</p>
        <p>#6. Using the sebum, test the grease removal of each shampoos</p>
        <p>#7. With a graduated cylinder, test the foaming level of each shampoos</p>
        <p>We also 3D printed our own shampoo bottles!</p>
        <h3>Data</h3>

            <img class="pfp" src="Images/IMG_1442.heic".png width=300>
        </div>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Artifical shampoo is the most effective type of shampoo for our hair,</p>
        <p>since it has the right cleaning power, highest grease removal ability, and highest foam level.</p>
        <p>Our hypothesis was partially correct, since the castile soap shammpoo performed average.</p>
