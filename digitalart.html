        <h3>My Pattern</h3>
        <p>These are the patterns I drew during Digital Art class. I picked two background colors, yellow and pink. It's
            a pattern
            of my favorite things. Swan is one of my favorite animals, ribbon is my favorite accessory, teddy bear gives
            me comfort,
            and my favorite flower is a rose. I learned how to draw of a pattern of my own, and how to duplicate the drawings to make the pattern.

            some cute ornamets on it. I learned how to draw a perfect cube and where to shade them.

        <h3>My Monster</h3>
        <p>This is a evil monster that I drew. He is an evil snowman! His name is Elaf, Olaf plus Evil. I also learned to turn this into a gif, and make it move by a website called Monster Mash.</p>
