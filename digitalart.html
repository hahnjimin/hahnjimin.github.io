        <h3>My Pattern</h3>
        <p>These are the patterns I drew during Digital Art class. I picked two background colors, yellow and pink. </p>
        <p>It's a pattern of my favorite things.</p> 
        <p>Swan is one of my favorite animals, ribbon is my favorite accessory, </p>
        <p>teddy bear gives me comfort,and my favorite flower is a rose. </p>
        <p>I learned how to draw of a pattern of my own.</p>
